# This is a simple & lightweight CLI-based RSA cryptography tool in Python
### **How to use it**

First, we need to install the `cryptography` module using the following method if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install crptography

# Then run :

python generate_keys.py # Generate the public and private keys
python encrypt # Encrypt the message and output it to cipher.bin
python decrypt.py # Display the ciphertext in plain text
```

**Note :** The keys and python files should be placed in the same directory unless this wouldn't work
